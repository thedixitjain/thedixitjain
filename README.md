## About Me

I am an AI Engineer focused on designing and deploying reliable LLM-powered systems.  
My work spans Agentic AI workflows, Retrieval-Augmented Generation architectures, and end-to-end ML pipelines that move from prototype to production.

I care deeply about system performance, inference cost optimization, and human-centered AI design.  
Currently, my work centers around enterprise RAG systems, multi-step reasoning agents, and scalable AI infrastructure.
